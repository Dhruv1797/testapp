        iOS Installation Instructions:
        
        This is a simulator build. To install on a real device, you'll need:
        
        Option 1 - Use Xcode:
        1. Download the project source code
        2. Open ios/Runner.xcworkspace in Xcode
        3. Connect your iOS device
        4. Select your device as the target
        5. Click Run to install directly
        
        Option 2 - For Simulator Testing:
        1. Download the magic-epaper-ios-simulator.zip
        2. Extract the Runner.app
        3. Drag Runner.app to iOS Simulator
        
        Option 3 - Create your own IPA:
        1. Download source and build with your Apple Developer account
        2. Use flutter build ipa with your signing certificates
        
        Note: Unsigned IPAs cannot be installed on physical devices without jailbreaking.
